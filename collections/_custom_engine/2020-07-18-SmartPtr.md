I have a plan to implement my own Memory Manager, replacing C/C++'s standard dynamic memory allocation in `malloc` and `new` which invoke the operating system's memory manager. However, in order to make my implementation work, I'll first need to re-implement C++'s Smart Pointers. I'll get more into the why and how of the memory manager in a future post.

## Types of Smart Pointers
The standard library has three types of smart pointers.

<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/shared_ptr" target="_blank>">`shared_ptr`</a> is a reference-counted smart pointer. Every copy increments the reference count and every destructor call decrements it. When the last reference is deleted the object is finally destroyed. What I really like about `shared_ptr` is that it implements garbage collection only RAII. There's no overhead of some garbage collector or dead memory waiting around to be garbage collected.

<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/weak_ptr" target="_blank>">`weak_ptr`</a> is a non-owning reference to a `shared_ptr`. A `weak_ptr` can only exist in context to an existing `shared_ptr`. Through the `weak_ptr` you can check if the object is still alive and also retrieve a `shared_ptr` to that object.

<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr" target="_blank>">`unique_ptr`</a> is like a `shared_ptr` but the reference count is locked at 1. It cannot be copied, only moved. When the `unique_ptr` goes out of scope, the object it references is destroyed. You can also release ownership to get a raw pointer. Then, if you wish, you can hand that raw pointer to a `shared_ptr` to let it manage the memory for you.

In my engine I'm only using `shared_ptr` and `weak_ptr` so far, so those are the only two I'm going to implement for now. I leave `unique_ptr` as an exercise to the reader :)

## The problem with `std::shared_ptr`

</figure>

The above diagram is a simplified depiction of how a `shared_ptr` works in C++. A `shared_ptr` has to data members:
- A pointer to the reference count.
- A pointer to the shared data.

Notice the `...` between each piece of data. That is intended to depict some sort of heap-allocation that was created and later freed. Fragmentation is the bane of memory managers because it increases the amount of time it takes to find a suitable location to allocate space and limits the maximum size allowed for an allocation.

`std::shared_ptr` is prone to increase fragmentation like any other standard library dynamic memory allocation in C/C++. The only way I know of to eliminate fragmentation is to have a memory manager that periodically will shuffle the memory around such that all free memory is completely contiguous.

Performing this "shuffle" would be completely impossible with `std::shared_ptr`. The memory manager would need to be able to go to every instance of a `std::shared_ptr` and change the pointer they're storing to the new address.

I've decided to go with a handle-based approach where a Smart Pointer doesn't actually reference the shared data directly but instead references a shared handle which references the data. This way, when the memory manager defragments the heap it can just go through all of the handles and update their addresses.

<figure>
<img src="{{ page.cwd }}assets/images/SharedPtr.png" alt="SharedPtr" width="600" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
</figure>

My `SharedPtr` only needs one data member: the pointer to the `Handle`. A `Handle` stores both the reference count and the pointer to the shared memory. The `Handles` are guaranteed to never be shuffled by the memory manager.

There's one glaring issue with my approach: Accessing the data requires two dereferences. This has the potential to thrash the cache and completely ruin performance. However, I'm not so certain this is the end of the world. Higher-level languages such as C# which implement even more complex systems must surely have at least two dereferences under the hood. I won't know for sure how much I'm paying for this defragmentation until I've finished implementing and benchmarking it, so we'll have to wait and see.

Something I do really like about my system is that my `SharedPtr` is half the size of `std::shared_ptr`. We're only talking 8 bytes verses 16 bytes, but I'd like to think that with how much I'm using Smart Pointers in my engine that these will add up.

## The Code
Something I'd first like to point out is that, for now, my Smart Pointers are using C++'s standard allocation with `operator new`. In the future I will integrate my own memory manager and all `Handles` will go into a static data structure. The challenge of how to implement Smart Pointers is separate from where exactly they allocate memory, so this article goes on.

`std::weak_ptr` cannot directly modify the referenced object without first acquiring a `std::shared_ptr` by calling `std::weak_ptr::lock()`. For convenience, I decided that I'd like to be able to dereference my own `WeakPtr`. With this change, there's a lot `SharedPtr` and `WeakPtr` have in common. As such, I've decided to make them share a common base class.

```c++
template<typename T>
class SmartPtr
{
protected:
	struct Handle final
	{
		T* ptr;
		uint32_t sharedCount;
		uint32_t weakCount;
		
		explicit Handle(T* ptr, const uint32_t count) noexcept :
			ptr(ptr),
			sharedCount(count),
			weakCount(0) {}					
		
		Handle() = default;
		Handle(const Handle&) = delete;
		Handle(Handle&&) noexcept = delete;
		Handle& operator=(const Handle&) = delete;
		Handle& operator=(Handle&&) noexcept = delete;
		~Handle() = default;
	};

	Handle* handle;

	explicit SmartPtr(Handle* handle = nullptr) noexcept :
		handle(handle) {}

	SmartPtr(const SmartPtr& other) noexcept :
		handle(other.handle) {}

	SmartPtr(SmartPtr&& other) noexcept :
		handle(other.handle)
	{
		other.handle = nullptr;
	}

	~SmartPtr() = default;
};
```

An odd thing you might notice is that `Handle` has two counts, one for `SharedPtrs` and `WeakPtrs`. We need to keep track of both because we can't destroy the `Handle` itself until no more `SmartPtrs` reference it at all. Let describe an example of something that could happen without the `weakCount`:

1. We have a `SharedPtr` and a `WeakPtr` that reference the same object.
2. The last `SharedPtr` is destroyed. As such, the shared object _as well as_ the `Handle` are destroyed.
3. The `WeakPtr` now references stale memory. But it gets worse.
4. A new `SharedPtr` is created and its `Handle` happens to go in the same place the previous `Handle` was.
5. The `WeakPtr` now references a completely different object from what it originally referenced.

```c++
template<typename T>
T& SmartPtr<T>::operator*()
{
	if (handle && handle->ptr)
	{
		return *handle->ptr;
	}
	throw NullReferenceException();
}

template<typename T>
const T& SmartPtr<T>::operator*() const
{
	return const_cast<SmartPtr<T>*>(this)->operator*();
}

template<typename T>
T* SmartPtr<T>::operator->()
{
	return &operator*();
}

template<typename T>
const T* SmartPtr<T>::operator->() const
{
	return const_cast<SmartPtr<T>*>(this)->operator->();
}

template<typename T>
SmartPtr<T>::operator bool() const noexcept
{
	return handle && handle->ptr;
}

template<typename T>
size_t SmartPtr<T>::ReferenceCount() noexcept
{
	return handle ? handle->sharedCount : 0;
}

template<typename T>
T* SmartPtr<T>::Raw() noexcept
{
	return handle ? handle->ptr : nullptr;
}
```

The remaining operators and methods are exactly what you'd expect. They perform a double-dereference to access the data and wisely call each-other to reduce duplicate code. Similar to the standard library, I provide an `operator bool` because many people (including myself) like to treat pointers as booleans rather than comparing to `nullptr`.

With the base class established,  the derived class `SharedPtr` hardly needs any methods, only constructors and assignment operators.

```c++
template<typename T>
class SharedPtr : public SmartPtr<T>
{
	using Base = SmartPtr<T>;

public:
	explicit SharedPtr(T* ptr) noexcept;

	template<Concept::Related<T> U>
	SharedPtr(const SharedPtr<U>& other) noexcept;
	template<Concept::Related<T> U>
	SharedPtr(SharedPtr<U>&& other) noexcept;
	
	template<Concept::Related<T> U>
	SharedPtr& operator=(const SharedPtr<U>& other) noexcept;
	template<Concept::Related<T> U>
	SharedPtr& operator=(SharedPtr<U>&& other) noexcept;

	SharedPtr() noexcept = default;
	SharedPtr(const SharedPtr& other) noexcept;
	SharedPtr(SharedPtr&& other) noexcept;
	SharedPtr& operator=(const SharedPtr& other) noexcept;
	SharedPtr& operator=(SharedPtr&& other) noexcept;
	~SharedPtr();

	template<typename... Args>
	static SharedPtr Make(Args... args)
	{
		return SharedPtr(new T(std::forward<Args>(args)...));
	}
};
```

The standard library has a `std::make_shared` free function for creating a `std::shared_ptr`. I've decided to move this inside of my class as a static method. But why exactly do we have this method anyway? Why not just use the constructor?

The issue comes with default construction. If `SharedPtr`'s constructor could take variadic arguments to pass along to the `T`'s constructor, then what happens to the default constructor? Do we construct a default-constructed `T`? Or do we create a `SharedPtr` to `nullptr`?

To avoid this ambiguity, `std::make_shared` was created. My alternative is `SharedPtr::Make`.

```c++
template<typename T>
SharedPtr<T>::SharedPtr(T* ptr) noexcept :
	Base(new typename Base::Handle(ptr, 1)) {}
```

The constructor which takes a raw pointer is useful for if you have a raw pointer (perhaps taken from a unique ptr) and want to let it be managed by RAII reference counting.

Notably, the pointer must be allocated in the same way `SharedPtr::Make` would allocate it. Meaning that if it was allocated outside of the memory manager then this will eventually lead to undefined behavior either when it comes time to defragment or when the object must be destroyed.

This actually isn't quite the full implementation of this constructor. See the section on `EnableSharedFromThis` below.

```c++
template<typename T>
SharedPtr<T>::SharedPtr(const SharedPtr& other) noexcept :
	Base(other)
{
	if (this->handle)
	{
		++this->handle->sharedCount;
	}
}

template<typename T>
SharedPtr<T>::SharedPtr(SharedPtr&& other) noexcept :
	Base(std::move(other)) {}
```

The move/copy constructors are simple. It's important we increment the reference count when copying. That's the whole point of reference counted smart objects.

```c++
template<typename T>
SharedPtr<T>& SharedPtr<T>::operator=(const SharedPtr& other) noexcept
{
	if (this != &other)
	{
		this->~SharedPtr();
		this->handle = other.handle;
		if (this->handle)
		{
			++this->handle->sharedCount;
		}
	}
	return *this;
}

template<typename T>
SharedPtr<T>& SharedPtr<T>::operator=(SharedPtr&& other) noexcept
{
	if (this != &other)
	{
		this->~SharedPtr();
		this->handle = other.handle;
		other.handle = nullptr;
	}
	return *this;
}
```

The assignment operators do nearly the same thing except they invoke the destructor before taking on the `other`'s `Handle`. This is because we're essentially destroying this reference to the handle. The destructor happens to contain all the logic necessary for handling what happens when we do that.

Something interesting is that we _must_ invoke the destructor with `this->~SharedPtr()` rather than simply `~SharedPtr()`. This is because we have an implicit `operator bool`. So what the compiler actually evaluates `~SharedPtr()` to is calling the default constructor, calling `operator bool` and then performing a bitwise not on the result.

```c++
template<typename T>
SharedPtr<T>::~SharedPtr()
{
	if (this->handle)
	{
		--this->handle->sharedCount;
		if (this->handle->sharedCount == 0)
		{
			if (this->handle->weakCount == 0)
			{
				delete this->handle;
				this->handle = nullptr;
			}
			else
			{
				delete this->handle->ptr;
				this->handle->ptr = nullptr;
			}
		}
	}		
}
```

The destructor has numerous checks to make sure it's safe to destroy the shared reference. If there's no more weak pointers to the `Handle` either, we can also destroy the handle itself.

```c++
template<typename T>
template<Concept::Related<T> U>
SharedPtr<T>::SharedPtr(const SharedPtr<U>& other) noexcept :
	Base(reinterpret_cast<const SharedPtr&>(other))
{
	if (this->handle)
	{
		++this->handle->sharedCount;
	}
}

template<typename T>
template<Concept::Related<T> U>
SharedPtr<T>::SharedPtr(SharedPtr<U>&& other) noexcept :
	Base(std::move(reinterpret_cast<SharedPtr&&>(other))) {}

template<typename T>
template<Concept::Related<T> U>
SharedPtr<T>& SharedPtr<T>::operator=(const SharedPtr<U>& other) noexcept
{
	this->~SharedPtr();
	this->handle = reinterpret_cast<const SharedPtr&>(other).handle;
	if (this->handle)
	{
		++this->handle->sharedCount;
	}
	return *this;
}

template<typename T>
template<Concept::Related<T> U>
SharedPtr<T>& SharedPtr<T>::operator=(SharedPtr<U>&& other) noexcept
{
	this->~SharedPtr();
	auto& handle = reinterpret_cast<const SharedPtr&>(other).handle;		
	this->handle = handle;
	handle = nullptr;
	return *this;
}
```

It's absolutely essential that we have copy/move semantics with `SharedPtrs` of different types. This is so we can instantiate a `SharedPtr` of a derived type and assign it to a `SharedPtr` of a base type. However, we shouldn't allow just _any_ conversion. Only related types. I'm using C++20 concepts to constrain the types allowed.

```c++
template<typename T, typename U>
concept Related = std::derived_from<T, U> ||
				  std::is_base_of_v<T, U> ||
				  std::is_same_v<T, U>;
```
There's plenty of ways a `Related` concept could be defined, this is the one I chose. Keep in mind that performance with concepts is typically not something to worry about at all. These are evaluated at compile-time so they have no effect on the runtime performance of your application. That said, they could have the potential to slow down compilations. If this were a project being built frequently and it was taking an inordinate amount of time to compile, I might look at simplifying this concept. Realistically, it would be much more likely for a build to be taking longer for reasons other than a 3-boolean type-check.

`WeakPtr` turns out to be nearly the same code, just with the destructor not destroying the shared reference, only the `Handle` when this happens to be the last `WeakPtr` being destroyed.

```c++
template<typename T>
class WeakPtr : public SmartPtr<T>
{
	using Base = SmartPtr<T>;

public:
	WeakPtr(const SharedPtr<T>& shared) noexcept :
		Base(reinterpret_cast<const WeakPtr&>(shared))
	{
		if (this->handle)
		{
			++this->handle->weakCount;
		}
	}
	
	WeakPtr() noexcept = default;

	WeakPtr(const WeakPtr& other) noexcept :
		Base(other.handle)
	{
		if (this->handle)
		{
			++this->handle->weakCount;
		}
	}

	WeakPtr(WeakPtr&& other) noexcept :
		Base(std::move(other)) {}

	WeakPtr& operator=(const WeakPtr& other) noexcept
	{
		if (this != &other)
		{
			this->~WeakPtr();
			this->handle = other.handle;
			if (this->handle)
			{
				++this->handle->weakCount;
			}
		}
		return *this;
	}

	WeakPtr& operator=(WeakPtr&& other) noexcept
	{
		if (this != &other)
		{
			this->~WeakPtr();
			this->handle = other.handle;
			other.handle = nullptr;
		}
		return *this;
	}

	~WeakPtr() noexcept
	{
		if (this->handle)
		{
			--this->handle->weakCount;
			if (this->handle->sharedCount == 0 && this->handle->weakCount == 0)
			{
				delete this->handle;
				this->handle = nullptr;
			}
		}
	}

	operator SharedPtr<T>() noexcept
	{
		return *reinterpret_cast<SharedPtr<T>*>(this);
	}

	bool Expired() const noexcept
	{
		return !this->handle || this->handle->sharedCount == 0; 
	}
};
```

Something neat to point out is that the implicit conversion operator for getting a `SharedPtr` from a `WeakPtr` only needs to do a `reinterpret_cast`. This is because on return the copy constructor of `SharedPtr` will be invoked and the reference count will end up being properly incremented.

## EnableSharedFromThis
If you read my post where I created an <a href="{{ establishingAHierarchy.url }}" target="_blank">Entity</a> you would know that I used <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/enable_shared_from_this" target="_blank">`std::enable_shared_from_this`</a> to be able to get a `std::shared_ptr` from the `this` pointer. To be able to transition the rest of my engine to using my own smart pointers, I would need to re-implement this as well. My implementation works exactly the same as the standard library's.

`EnableSharedFromThis` works by having a single data member: a `WeakPtr`. That `WeakPtr` references the same handle that all `SharedPtr` to that object reference. The object _must_ be instantiated as a `SharedPtr` such as through `SharedPtr::Make`. If the object was not, such as if it were stack allocated, then the `WeakPtr` has nothing to reference and the behavior is undefined.

```c++
template<typename T>
SharedPtr<T>::SharedPtr(T* ptr) noexcept :
	Base(new typename Base::Handle(ptr, 1))
{
	if constexpr (std::derived_from<T, EnableSharedFromThis<T>>)
	{
		reinterpret_cast<SharedPtr&>(ptr->weakThis).handle = this->handle;
		++this->handle->weakCount;
	}
}
```

`EnableSharedFromThis` actually doesn't do anything itself to set up the `WeakPtr`. All of the work is actually done inside of `SharedPtr`'s constructor. At compile-time, we can determine if the type we're storing inherits from `EnableSharedFromThis`. If it does, then we can assign the `WeakPtr` properly.

```c++
template<typename Derived>
class EnableSharedFromThis
{	
	WeakPtr<Derived> weakThis{};

protected:
	constexpr EnableSharedFromThis() noexcept = default;

	EnableSharedFromThis(const EnableSharedFromThis&) noexcept :
		weakThis() {}

	EnableSharedFromThis& operator=(const EnableSharedFromThis&) noexcept
	{
		return *this;
	}

	EnableSharedFromThis(EnableSharedFromThis&&) noexcept = default;
	EnableSharedFromThis& operator=(EnableSharedFromThis&&) noexcept = default;
	~EnableSharedFromThis() noexcept = default;

public:
	SharedPtr<Derived> SharedFromThis()
	{
		return SharedPtr<Derived>(WeakFromThis());
	}

	SharedPtr<const Derived> SharedFromThis() const
	{
		return const_cast<EnableSharedFromThis*>(this)->SharedFromThis();
	}

	WeakPtr<Derived> WeakFromThis()
	{
		return weakThis;
	}

	WeakPtr<const Derived> WeakFromThis() const
	{
		return const_cast<EnableSharedFromThis*>(this)->WeakFromThis();
	}
};
```

The only funky thing about `EnableSharedFromThis` itself is that on copy we don't touch the `WeakPtr`. It may seem strange, but it's actually not the job of `EnableSharedFromThis` to modify its own data member at all. That's because inside of `EnableSharedFromThis`'s constructors, the `SharedPtr` we need to reference isn't yet created. It's not until `SharedPtr`'s constructors that we can think about initializing the `WeakPtr`.

---

The principal of reference-counted smart pointers is pretty simple. Just increment the count on construction and copy while decrementing it on destruction. What makes smart pointers tricky are all the edge cases. I had 90% of the code finished in under and hour but it wasn't until I started integrating it into my engine that the bugs started popping up. These edge cases weren't obvious enough for me to know to explicitly unit test them beforehand, so debugging them within my engine was a chore, especially since I'm instantiating a lot of smart pointers at static initialization time and Visual Studio's debugger seems to have trouble knowing the values of things before `main`.

Overall, it wasn't too difficult though and now I've got a piece of the puzzle for my memory manager ready.
